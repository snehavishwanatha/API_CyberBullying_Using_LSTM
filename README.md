# TextClassification_Using_LSTM

Created an API used to detect and avoid abusive contents/comments/posts on various social media and chatting platforms.

    Built a LSTM and RNN model for text classification as abusive or non-abusive.
    Used Pickle to dump the trained model which helps in avoiding the model to be trained everytime a query request is posted.
    Used Flask to create the API for trained model and launched it using Heroku web hosting service.
    Created a simple web-page as UI for testing and making queries to the API.
